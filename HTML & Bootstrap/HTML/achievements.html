        <h2>Noble Achievements</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Nonviolent Resistance (Ahimsa):</b> Gandhi is perhaps best known
            for his philosophy of nonviolence, or ahimsa. He championed peaceful
            resistance to oppression, inspiring movements worldwide. His
            commitment to nonviolent civil disobedience led to India's
            independence and has influenced global leaders like Martin Luther
            King Jr. and Nelson Mandela.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Leadership in the Indian Independence Movement: </b>Gandhi led
            Indiaâ€™s struggle for independence from British colonial rule through
            nonviolent protests, including the Salt March (1930), the Quit India
            Movement (1942), and other mass movements. His leadership united
            millions in a nonviolent fight for freedom.
          </li>
          <li><b>Promotion of Social Reforms:</b> Gandhi was an advocate for social justice, including the abolition of the caste system, the upliftment of the untouchables (whom he called "Harijans," or "children of God"), and the promotion of women's rights. His efforts to improve the social fabric of India went beyond political independence.</li>
